                    <p className="about-text">Fast-forward to today, Iâ€™m currently studying to become a Frontend/ app developer. Even though the struggle with imposter syndrome is real, I have found a nerdy love for figuring out how to solve the problems and errors that comes with coding. I am eager to learn more about the world of web development and the beauty behind building useful websites. </p>
